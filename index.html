        <p> My favorite hobby is art. Art is endless and there are no rules what-so-ever. My fvavorite thing to do is usually painting and making things for my room. Art can also be calming for some poeple. Research also found that art strongly correlates with high scores in reading and math. Art usually avoids being on screens and requires for you to think of new ideas.</p>
